# Project-Euler-Problems-Scraper
i just wanted to solve these project euler problems but wasn't able to since i was having internet issues that time. 

this is unfinished. But mainly this is mainly for me to be better at web scraping. I will also be using concepts of file 
input and output, since my plan is to save the problems into separate files. If I can do that all, next is to find a way to 
view these files with an interface.
